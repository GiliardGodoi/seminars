# Notes

This seminar I analyse the paper *Combining prompt-based language models and weak supervision for labeling named entity recognition on legal documents* by Oliveira et al. (2024).

The official publication can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10506-023-09388-1).

## About the slide deck

The deck slides were made using Markdown and the Marp tool. Please, see the official [Marp documentation](https://marp.app/) for more details.

I also used the [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) extension to help me write the presentation.
