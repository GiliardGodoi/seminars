# About this template

This template is intended to make slide deck using Markdown notations and the Marp tool.
Please, see the official [Marp documentation](https://marp.app/) for more details.

I also used the [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) extension to help me write the presentation.
